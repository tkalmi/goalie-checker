# goalie-checker üèíü•Ö

CLI for checking tonight's starting goalies in the NHL.

## How It Works?

The program simply fetches <a href="https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/starting-goalies/">https://www.dailyfaceoff.com/starting-goalies/</a>, parses the contents using BeautifulSoup, and prints the starting goalies for each of tonight's games. Note that the goalie situation may be fluid even close to the game.

## Running the Program

Requires Python 3. Install the required packages, e.g., with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the program with
```
python3 goalie.py
```

Note that the bindings to `python` and `pip` may vary depending on your system.

## Example Output

(Everything is `Uncofirmed`, as the league is in COVID19 lockdown while writing this).
